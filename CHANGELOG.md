# Changelog

All notable changes to ZulipChat MCP are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Agent control plane** for session-scoped Claude Code workflows. New core tool `ensure_agent_session` and extended tools `list_sessions`, `close_agent_session`, backed by a stable agent profile registered via the rebuilt `register_agent`.
- **Claude Code plugin** at `integrations/claude-code/plugin/` with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, hook bridge, three skills (`zulipchat-session-operator`, `zulipchat-notifyme`, `zulipchat-loop`), and the `zulip-session-operator` subagent.
- **Standalone `.claude/` template** at `integrations/claude-code/.claude/` for users who want to vendor the integration into their own repo without the plugin format.
- **`zulipchat-mcp-hook` CLI** that bridges Claude Code lifecycle events (`SessionStart`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `Notification idle_prompt`, `StopFailure`, `TaskCompleted`, `SessionEnd`) into the bound Zulip topic.
- **`zulipchat-mcp-integrate export --client claude-code`** subcommand to generate the plugin or standalone scaffold into a target directory, with bot-config and extended-tools modes.
- DuckDB tables `agent_profiles`, `agent_sessions`, `agent_requests`, `session_events`. Migration is additive; existing tables and rows are untouched.

### Changed
- `register_agent` now accepts optional `agent_name`, `owner_email`, `stream_name`, `topic_prefix`, `metadata` keyword arguments. Existing calls without arguments still work. The return shape is new: `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `agent_type`, `owner_email`, `stream`, `topic_prefix`.
- `agent_message`, `request_user_input`, and `wait_for_response` now operate session-scoped against the topic bound by `ensure_agent_session`. The previous channel-broadcast behavior is replaced.
- Hook commands in the Claude Code plugin invoke `uvx --from zulipchat-mcp zulipchat-mcp-hook` so the bridge resolves whether the package is installed persistently or run ephemerally.
- Setup wizard command corrected to `uvx --from zulipchat-mcp zulipchat-mcp-setup` across README, troubleshooting, installation, quick-start, and setup-wizard docs. (PR #9, credit: @odurif0)

### Removed
- AFK mode tools `enable_afk_mode`, `disable_afk_mode`, `get_afk_status`, and the merged `afk_mode` tool. The session model (`ensure_agent_session` plus `close_agent_session`) replaces them.

### Upgrading from 0.6.x
- DuckDB schema upgrade runs automatically on first start of v0.7.0. No manual migration is required.
- Scripts that called the AFK tools must be updated to the session model.
- Scripts that parsed the previous `register_agent` return keys must read from the new keys (`agent_id`, `stream`, `topic_prefix`).
- For the new Claude Code plugin, install via Claude Code's plugin command and ensure `~/.zuliprc` (and optionally `~/.zuliprc-bot`) exist. Hooks call `uvx --from zulipchat-mcp zulipchat-mcp-hook`, so no global package install is required.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Critical: Rate limit exhaustion** — Message listener was hardcoded to start on every server boot, long-polling Zulip's `/events` endpoint regardless of the `--enable-listener` flag. Multiple MCP client sessions would all poll simultaneously, exhausting the per-user rate limit. Listener is now off by default and lazy-started only when an agent tool that needs it is invoked. (PR #8, credit: @klutchell)
- **Tight-loop on API errors** — When the listener received a 429 or other error response, it returned an empty list and immediately retried with no delay, generating thousands of requests per minute. Now returns a sentinel on error and applies exponential backoff (2s base, 120s cap).
- **Stale DuckDB lock after unclean shutdown** — When a server process died without closing the database, the WAL file persisted and blocked all new connections permanently. The database layer now extracts the locking PID from DuckDB's error message, checks if the process is alive, and removes the stale WAL file if the process is dead. (Fixes #7, reported by: @JaimeCernuda)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- `zulipchat-mcp-integrate` CLI for generating copy-paste integration snippets across MCP clients.
- Integration package templates under `integrations/` for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, OpenCode, VS Code/Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, and generic MCP clients.
- Automated release preflight checklist: `scripts/release_preflight.py`.
- Automated pre-release smoke runner: `scripts/pre_release_smoke.sh`.
- New setup wizard and integration docs: `docs/user-guide/setup-wizard.md`, `docs/integrations/*`.

### Changed
- Setup wizard (`zulipchat-mcp-setup`) now supports core vs extended tool mode, additional client targets, and config-file output paths.
- Publish workflow hardened with stricter version checks and wheel-installed entrypoint smoke tests before PyPI publish.
- Documentation refreshed and expanded for v0.6.x across user guide, API reference, integration pages, security/support/community docs, and contributor guides.
- Packaging metadata and source distribution contents aligned with public docs/integrations assets.

### Fixed
- `--debug` now correctly enables DEBUG-level structured logging in `zulipchat-mcp`.
- Setup wizard exits cleanly in non-interactive terminals and better prioritizes user vs bot zuliprc selection defaults.
- Release smoke script now installs the exact wheel for the target version, avoiding multi-wheel conflicts in `dist/`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Two-tier tool registration**: Default mode registers 19 core tools (~87% token reduction); `--extended-tools` flag or `ZULIPCHAT_EXTENDED_TOOLS=1` enables full set (~55 tools)
- **7 merged tools**: `manage_message_flags` (replaces 7 flag tools), `get_user` (replaces by-id + by-email), `manage_user_mute`, `toggle_reaction`, `manage_task`, `afk_mode`, `manage_scheduled_message`
- **CLI**: Added `--extended-tools` argument to `server.py`
- **Concise descriptions**: Core and extended tool descriptions optimized for token efficiency

### Removed
- **events.py stub**: Dead code that delegated to agents.py removed
- **Legacy registration path**: `server.py` no longer calls individual `register_*_tools()` functions; uses `register_core_tools()` / `register_extended_tools()` instead

### Added
- `register_core_tools()` and `register_extended_tools()` in `tools/__init__.py`
- `tests/tools/test_tool_tiers.py`: 36 tests covering registration counts, merged tool dispatch, error paths

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **CI fully green**: Resolved all CI failures across Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 — 10 mypy errors, 1 test failure, 2 ruff lint errors
- **Null credential guards**: Added validation in `identity.py` and `scheduler.py` to fail fast on missing credentials instead of passing `None`
- **Test compatibility**: Fixed enum `str()` rendering difference between Python 3.10 and 3.11+ in narrow filter tests
- **Type annotations**: Added missing return types in `config.py`, type annotation for `database.py` singleton flag

### Added
- **Auto-publish workflow**: `publish.yml` builds and uploads to PyPI via trusted publisher when a GitHub release is published
- **Issue templates**: Bug report and feature request templates with structured fields
- **PR template**: Checklist matching CONTRIBUTING.md standards
- **Release checklist**: `RELEASING.md` with step-by-step release runbook
- **Repo discoverability**: GitHub Discussions enabled, topics added, homepage set to PyPI

### Changed
- **Agent guides updated**: CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md now codify release process, open-source community practices, and correct coverage gate (60%, not 85%)
- **Tool counts corrected**: README and RELEASE.md now match actual registered tools (Messaging: 16, System: 5, Total: 67)
- **Labels**: Added project-specific labels (`community`, `fastmcp`, `mcp-tools`, `dependencies`, `breaking-change`, `needs-triage`) and retroactively labeled all issues/PRs
- **bump_version.py**: Fixed stale POLISHING.md reference, now targets RELEASE.md

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Teleport-Chat** (`teleport_chat` tool): Bidirectional agent-human messaging via Zulip DMs and channels. Bot identity for private back-channel; user identity for all org-facing actions. Supports fuzzy name resolution and optional wait-for-reply
- **Fuzzy User Resolution** (`resolve_user` tool): Resolve display names to Zulip emails with fuzzy matching — "Jaime" just works without knowing the formal email
- **Always-On Message Listener**: Listener runs automatically on startup (no longer gated behind `--enable-listener`). Receives all messages (DMs + streams), not just Agents-Channel
- **Queue State Persistence**: Listener queue ID and last_event_id survive restarts via `listener_state` DB table
- **AFK Auto-Return**: `auto_return_at` is now computed from `hours` parameter and enforced — AFK mode expires as expected
- **Cache Warmup**: User and stream caches pre-populated on server startup for instant fuzzy resolution

### Fixed
- **`poll_agent_events` always empty**: `_process_message` returned early when no `request_id` matched, never inserting into `agent_events`. Now always stores events
- **Listener missed DMs**: Event queue was narrowed to Agents-Channel only. Removed narrow — bot now receives all visible messages
- **AFK `auto_return_at` never set**: `set_afk_state` hardcoded `NULL`. Now computes expiry from hours
- **Zulip display vs delivery email mismatch**: Added `is_same_user()` to `UserCache` to correctly match `user12345@org.zulipchat.com` against `name@university.edu`

### Changed
- `--enable-listener` flag kept for backward compat but listener is now always-on
- `ServiceManager` always starts regardless of flag or AFK state

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **FastMCP 3.0 Upgrade**: Replaced removed `on_duplicate_tools/resources/prompts` and `include_fastmcp_meta` constructor kwargs with `on_duplicate="warn"` (Issue #4)
- **File Download URLs**: Normalized `/user_uploads/` paths to full `https://` URLs and resolved auth by identity (Issue #3)
- **Broken Test Suite**: Fixed 5 test files with missing mock patches, stale DB API references, and syntax errors (520 tests passing)

### Changed
- Pinned `fastmcp[anthropic]>=3.0.0,<4.0.0`

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- ConfigManager now uses singleton pattern for consistent CLI arg handling
- All logging outputs to stderr (no stdout pollution for MCP STDIO)

### Added
- SECURITY.md with responsible disclosure policy

### Fixed
- CLI arguments now respected by all tools (singleton config)

---

## [0.4.3] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **Search Timeout**: Fixed `search_messages` timeout when using time filters without narrow (15s → <1s)
- **Daily Summary**: Fixed `get_daily_summary` returning 0 messages due to invalid `sent_after:` operator
- **Wildcard Search**: Fixed wildcard query `*` returning empty results
- **Python 3.12+**: Fixed `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings

### Improved
- **Test Coverage**: Increased from 66% to 69% (484 tests, 0 warnings)

---

## [0.4.2] - 2025-01-20

### Added
- **Privacy Policy**: Added `PRIVACY.md` and privacy section in README (required for MCP directory listings)

- **249 New Tests**: Comprehensive test suite from Gemini QA audit (411 total tests)
- **Emoji Registry**: Approved emoji validation for agent reactions (`src/zulipchat_mcp/core/emoji_registry.py`)

### Changed
- **Version Reset**: Moved from 2.5.x to 0.4.x versioning scheme
- **MCP Spec Compliance**: Improved sampling, emoji registry, and error messages
- **Coverage Threshold**: Adjusted to 60% (realistic for full codebase testing)
